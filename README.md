# TT-02R Arduino Remote Control Project 🚗

This repository contains the Arduino code and project files for my **Tamiya TT-02R RC car**, where I replaced the standard receiver with an Arduino-based system using the PCA9685 for motor/servo control.

## 🔧 Project Overview
- **Chassis:** Tamiya TT-02R  
- **Control:** Custom Arduino receiver + transmitter  
- **Features:**  
  - Steering and throttle control  
  - Swivel head servo  
  - Three forward speed modes  
  - Reverse logic (double-tap style)
